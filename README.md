   3. Create a branch off main named <yourusername>/<appropriate branch name>
   4. Add code to fulfill all requirements
   5. Create a Pull Request into Main and assign user 'stampinup' as a reviewer

3. Create a cypress test suite that validates add to cart functionality
4. DO NOT submit any credentials to the repository

## Hints
- Feel free to ask questions early, and often
- We invite you to go beyond the requirements so that your submission stands out but keep it reasonable, spending more than a couple days on this is likely overkill.
- There is no time limit nor recommended amount of time, within reason. A thorough and thoughtful submission that takes a day will be preferred over a 30 minute hastily thrown together submission. 
- Commit as if you were at work, small atomic commits are preferred over one large commit.


## Bonus
Finding a bug on our production site www.stampinup.com
